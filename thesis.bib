abstract = {We review the recent theoretical and experimental progress regarding the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) behavior of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions, also known as the Lieb–Liniger gas. In the first section, we review the theory of the Lieb–Liniger gas, introducing the key notions of the rapidities and of the rapidity distribution. The latter characterizes the Lieb–Liniger gas after relaxation and is at the heart of GHD. We also present the asymptotic regimes of the Lieb–Liniger gas with their dedicated approximate descriptions. In the second section we enter the core of the subject and review the theoretical results of GHD in 1D Bose gases. The third and fourth sections are dedicated to experimental results obtained in cold atom experiments: the experimental realization of the Lieb–Liniger model is presented in section 3, with a selection of key results for systems at equilibrium, and section 4 presents the experimental tests of the GHD theory. In section 5 we review the effects of atom losses, which, assuming slow loss processes, can be described within the GHD framework. We conclude with a few open questions.}

abstract = {The general properties of the factorized S-matrix in two-dimensional space-time are considered. The relation between the factorization property of the scattering theory and the infinite number of conservation laws of the underlying field theory is discussed. The factorization of the total S-matrix is shown to impose hard restrictions on two-particle matrix elements: they should satisfy special identities, the so-called factorization equations. The general solution of the unitarity, crossing and factorization equations is found for the S-matrices having isotopic O(N)-symmetry. The solution turns out to have different properties for the cases N = 2 and N ⩾ 3. For N = 2 the general solution depends on one parameter (of coupling constant type), whereas the solution for N ⩾ 3 has no parameters but depends analytically on N. The solution for N = 2 is shown to be an exact soliton S-matrix of the sine-Gordon model (equivalently the massive Thirring model). The total S-matrix of the model is constructed. In the case of N ⩾ 3 there are two “minimum” solutions, i.e., those having a minimum set of singularities. One of them is shown to be an exact S matrix of the quantum O(N)-symmetric nonlinear σ-model, the other is argued to describe the scattering of elementary particles of the Gross-Neveu model.}

    abstract = {A rigorous one‐one correspondence is established between one‐dimensional systems of bosons and of spinless fermions. This correspondence holds irrespective of the nature of the interparticle interactions, subject only to the restriction that the interaction have an impenetrable core. It is shown that the Bose and Fermi eigenfunctions are related by ψB=ψFA, where A(x1 … xn) is +1 or −1 according as the order pq … r, when the particle coordinates xj are arranged in the order xp\&lt;xq\&lt; … \&lt;xr, is an even or an odd permutation of 1 … n. The energy spectra of the two systems are identical, as are all configurational probability distributions, but the momentum distributions are quite different. The general theory is illustrated by application to the special case of impenetrable point particles; the one‐one correspondence between bosons with this particular interaction and completely noninteracting fermions leads to a rigorous solution of this many‐boson problem.},
